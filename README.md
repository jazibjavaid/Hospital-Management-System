# Hospital-Management-System

I. Mission Statement

The healthcare industry has always faced the challenge of consolidating patient data and healthcare information in one place. Unfortunately, this usually results in the loss or mismanagement of critical information and may hinder the delivery of effective and timely care. In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive and integrated database system for a healthcare management system to improve patient information management efficiency. Furthermore, this database system has the potential to be employed on an international scale in order to keep up with the modern demands of public health.
The following challenges will be addressed by the developed healthcare management system:
• Management of patient information: typically, healthcare providers rely on paper-based records or multiple systems to store patient data. This makes it challenging for providers to maintain accurate and up-to-date records, leading to errors and inefficiencies in the care delivery process. The Healthcare Management System will centralize all patient data, making it easy to access and update for all authorized healthcare providers. Furthermore, moving from paper-based records to an online storage system can reduce unnecessary expenses for health centers.
• Limited access to patient data: Healthcare providers need immediate access to a patient's medical history, including prior diagnoses, treatments, and medications. This information is difficult to access, leading to incomplete or inaccurate patient data. The Healthcare Management System will enhance the accessibility of healthcare providers to patient data, which is critical when rapid clinical decisions have to be made, such as in emergency cases.
• Fragmented healthcare system: Healthcare providers may work across multiple hospitals or clinics with numerous designs to manage patient information. This can cause various difficulties in sharing information, leading to delays in treatment and poor quality of services. The Healthcare Management System will facilitate the sharing of patient information between different healthcare centers, which has the capability to be employed on an international scale for multiple hospitals.
• Inefficient appointment scheduling: Scheduling appointments can be time-consuming as healthcare providers rely on paper-based or manual systems. The Healthcare Management System will provide an automated appointment scheduling system, reducing the administrative burden on providers and improving the patient experience.
Overall, the Healthcare Management System not only improves patient information management and the quality of health services but also reduces inefficiencies in the healthcare system. By providing straightforward access to patient data, enhancing appointment scheduling, and facilitating information sharing, we aim to provide a system that will benefit both patients and healthcare providers.
